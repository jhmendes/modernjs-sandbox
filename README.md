# Modern Javascript from the Beginning

This repository is a sandbox for all code lessons and challenges from Brad Travery's [Modern Javascript from the Beginning course](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/)

After spending the last few months focusing in on CSS, I'm now turning my attention back to Javascript.  This course will serve as a review of the basics as well as a springboard into more advanced concepts.  Any projects from this course will receive their own repository.
